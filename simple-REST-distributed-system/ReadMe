Details
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. A ring of distributed nodes is created on startup (nodeid and ports configured in application-context.xml)

Nodes with id (0,200,400,600,800) are created at start up


2.To view details of the ring use service (http://localhost:8080/simple-ds/api/nodeService/ringView)


3.To add key value to a node use the following service

http://localhost:8080/simple-ds/api/nodeService/store/{nodeId}/{key}/{value}

e.g http://localhost:8080/simple-ds/api/nodeService/store/200/250/testvalue

- nodeId must be a valid node that exist in the ring

- key is an int

- value is a string


4. To lookup key value use the following service

http://localhost:8080/simple-ds/api/nodeService/lookup/{startNode}/{key}

e.g http://localhost:8080/simple-ds/api/nodeService/lookup/200/250

- startNode id int must be a valid node from where to start search

- key int for which to look the value


5. Doc and comments are added to code where required
